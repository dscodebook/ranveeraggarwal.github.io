###Brief description of the project:
We have implemented the classic game of Chess. By default, the game is supposed to be a 1 player game which uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for finding an optimal move upto a certain depth(default 2). However, both the depth and the mode can be changed to 2 player as well.
