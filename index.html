<p>Hi! I'm Ranveer Aggarwal, a junior undergrad pursuing B.Tech. with honours in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay.</p>
<p>Apart from sitting in front of my laptop doing random stuff, I like to try my fingers on the strings of my Guitar. Writing (sometimes creative) and blogging are my other hobbies.</p>
<p>I'm always up for projects, and in case you have an opportunity to offer (<span style="color:#d84432;">No PHP please</span>!), you can reach me at ranveer [at] cse [dot] iitb [dot] ac [dot] in. </p>
